        "content_1": "<p>Tattoos often represent feelings and thoughts that are unspoken or trapped in ones self consciousness battling ill at easement. In my case the signature body art hand tattoo - CREATE was totally the opposite. The crossroads of my Hip Hop journey instilled a sense of psychological resilience which allowed my imagination, and dreams to manifest freely. Simply putâ€¦ tattoos are permanent, but the tattoo CREATE symbolizes<br\/>evolving endlessly. The placement on the hand is in relation to giving back orsharing GODS gifts with the world. ~ Kenglomerate<\/p>"
