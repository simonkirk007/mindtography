        "content": "<p>Since the beginning of time, all cultures have found the importance of myths threading the reality of human conditioning with imagination. Art has allowed our minds to capture glimpses of the past, present, and yet in some cases predicting our future. Is it a gift or a curse? The answer will define you. Artists are a rare breed of individuals.We are gifted with the ability to spark thoughts that speak to the soul, with the heart to dare to be different running in our veins.<\/p>",

        "content_1": "<p>Tattoos often represent feelings and thoughts that are unspoken or trapped in ones self consciousness battling ill at easement. In my case the signature body art hand tattoo - CREATE was totally the opposite. The crossroads of my Hip Hop journey instilled a sense of<br\/>psychological resilience which allowed my imagination, and dreams to manifest freely. Simply put… tattoos are permanent, but the tattoo CREATE symbolizes<br\/>evolving endlessly. The placement on the hand is in relation to giving back or sharing GODS gifts with the world. ~ Kenglomerate<\/p>"
